    <!--The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.

    <h1>Sticky Position</h1>
    <p>
        An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
        A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. 
        It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
    </p>
    <div class="sticky">
        This div element has position: sticky; Check It in mobile viewport.
    </div>
    <h1>Static Position</h1>
    <p>
        An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way;
         it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:
    </p>
    <div class="static">
        This div element has position: static;
    </div>
    <h1>Relative Position</h1>
    <p>
        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. 
        Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
    </p>
    <div class="relative">
        This div element has position: relative;
    </div>
    <h1>Fixed Position</h1>
    <p>
        An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled.
         The top, right, bottom, and left properties are used to position the element.
    </p>
    <div class="fixed">
        This div element has position: fixed;
    </div>
    <h1>Absolute Position</h1>
    <p>
        An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
        However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.   
        Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
